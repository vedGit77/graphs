// On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

// A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.
means that if 1 stone is @ (0,0) and the other one is @ (100,0), then also 1 of them will be removed.

// Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, 
// return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

// Example :
// Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
// 1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
// 2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
// 3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
// 4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
// 5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
// Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.


// SOLUTION:

// One sentence to solve:
// Connected stones can be reduced to 1 stone,
// the maximum stones can be removed = stones number - islands number.
// so just count the number of "islands".


// 1. Connected stones
// Two stones are connected if they are in the same row or same col.
// Connected stones will build a connected graph.
// It's obvious that in one connected graph,
// we can't remove all stones.

// We have to have one stone left.
// An intuition is that, in the best strategy, we can remove until 1 stone.

// I guess you may reach this step when solving the problem.
// But the important question is, how?


// 2. A failed strategy
// Try to remove the least degree stone
// Like a tree, we try to remove leaves first.
// Some new leaf generated.
// We continue this process until the root node left.

// However, there can be no leaf.
// When you try to remove the least in-degree stone,
// it won't work on this "8" like graph:
// [[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
// [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
// [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
// [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
// [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]

// The stone in the center has least degree = 2.
// But if you remove this stone first,
// the whole connected stones split into 2 parts,
// and you will finish with 2 stones left.
  

// 3. A good strategy: Count the number of islands
// We call a connected graph as an island.
// One island must have at least one stone left.
// The maximum stones can be removed = stones number - islands number

// The whole problem is transferred to:
// What is the number of islands?

// You can show all your skills on a DFS implementation,
// and solve this problem as a normal one.


// 4. Search on the index, not the points
// When we search on points,
// we alternately change our view on a row and on a col.

// We think:
// a row index, connect two stones on this row
// a col index, connect two stones on this col.

// In another viewï¼š
// A stone, connect a row index and col.

// Have this idea in mind, the solution can be much simpler.
// The number of islands of points,
// is the same as the number of islands of indexes.


// 5. Union-Find
// I use union find to solve this problem.
// As I mentioned, the elements are not the points, but the indexes.

// a. for each point, union two indexes.
// b. return (points number - union number)


// Complexity
// union and find functions have worst case O(N), amortize O(1)
// The whole union-find solution with path compression,
// has O(N) Time, O(N) Space
