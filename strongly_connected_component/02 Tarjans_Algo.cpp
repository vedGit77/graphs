// Kosaraju requires 2 traversals of an undirected graph
// Tarjans algo requires only 1

// Strongly Connected Component relates to directed graph only, but Disc and Low values relate to both directed and undirected graph

// A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. 
// A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.

// Tarjan Algorithm is based on following facts: 
// 1. DFS search produces a DFS tree/forest 
// 2. Strongly Connected Components form subtrees of the DFS tree. 
// 3. If we can find the head of such subtrees, we can print/store all the nodes in that subtree (including head) and that will be one SCC. 
// 4. There is no back edge from one SCC to another (There can be cross edges, but cross edges will not be used while processing the graph).

// To find head of a SCC, we calculate disc and low array (as done for articulation point, bridge, biconnected component). 
// As discussed in the previous posts, low[u] indicates earliest visited vertex (the vertex with minimum discovery time) that can be reached from 
// subtree rooted with u. A node u is head if disc[u] = low[u].

// To track the subtree rooted at head, we can use a stack (keep pushing node while visiting). 
// When a head node found, pop all nodes from stack till you get head out of stack.

// To make sure, we donâ€™t consider cross edges, when we reach a node which is already visited, 
// we should process the visited node only if it is present in stack, else ignore the node.
