A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into TWO independent sets, U and V such that 
every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. 
In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. 
We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.

A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. 

In a Bipartite graph, adjacent nodes can NOT have SAME COLOUR.

Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors. For example, see the following graph. 
It is not possible to color a cycle graph with odd cycle using two colors.
